This program is intended to provide a function for each of the concepts and operations taught in the most introductory Linear ALgebra Courses

This includes:

Vectors
Projections and Perpindiculars
Matrices
Sets and Spans
Diagonalization
Orthogonal Diagonalization
Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors and Eigenspaces

Functionality will allow for all operations taught in the course to be performed by this code and displayed for use.

More complex operations will be attempted like maybe row reductions and others.
Things like calculating projections, dot/cross products, normalizing vectors and orthonormalizing sets of vectors should hopefully be doable

Requirements:

Vector Class: Allows for the creation of vectors in R3, because dynamic vectors are quite complicated.
    Dot operator 
    Cross operator 
    Projection operator
    Perpindicular operator
    Normalizing operator

Matrix Class: Allows for the creation of m by n matrices 
    Row reduction algorithm?

Set Class: just a group of vectors or matrices
    Orthogonalize a set
    Maybe check if the set spans R^n where n is the dimension of the set?
